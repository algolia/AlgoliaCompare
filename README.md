**Custom Demos?**

You can style this for a custom demo and host it on netlify! 

Make sure to edit the default config so that the base link becomes shareable without an ugly `?config=` string.

**Running Locally?**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and mess around.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i
